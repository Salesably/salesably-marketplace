# Keyword Research

This skill identifies high-value content opportunities by finding the intersection of audience interest, business value, and market opportunity—without requiring expensive SEO tools.

## Objective

Discover content topics that sit at the intersection of six critical factors: what you can credibly write about, what your audience wants, what drives business, what people search for, where competitors are weak, and what's feasible to create.

## The 6 Circles Method

Content gold exists where these six factors overlap:
