# Newsletter

This skill creates newsletters people actually want to read—not just promotional blasts that get ignored or unsubscribed from.

## Objective

Build recurring engagement through newsletters that deliver consistent value, strengthen audience relationships, and naturally drive business goals.

## Intake Questions

Before creating newsletter content, gather context:

1. **Audience**: Who are subscribers? What do they care about?
2. **Frequency**: How often do you send? (Daily, weekly, monthly)
3. **Brand voice**: What tone should the newsletter have? (From `brand-voice` skill)
4. **Primary goal**: Education, entertainment, conversion, or community?
5. **Existing content**: What blog posts, insights, or resources can be repurposed?
6. **Unique angle**: What can you offer that no other newsletter does?
7. **Past performance**: What formats/topics have worked well or poorly?

## The 9 Newsletter Formats

## Engagement Hooks

First 1-3 lines that prevent immediate delete:

- **Specific examples**: Use a real-world scenario or name a specific tool/event.
- **Human touch**: Include a "un-AI" statement (humor or a bold opinion).
- **Relatable frustration**: Show you understand exactly what the reader is going through.

**Avoid opening with**:
- "Hope you're doing well!"
- "Happy [day of week]!"
- "In this issue..."
- Self-focused statements
