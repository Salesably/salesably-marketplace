# Lead Magnet

This skill creates irresistible opt-in offers that attract qualified leads—people who will eventually become customers, not just freebie seekers.

## Objective

Design lead magnets that solve a specific, urgent problem for the target audience while naturally qualifying them as potential buyers.

## Intake Questions

Before creating a lead magnet, gather context:

1. **Target audience**: Who exactly should opt in? (Be specific—job title, situation, goal)
2. **Main pain point**: What single problem keeps them up at night?
3. **Desired transformation**: What does success look like for them?
4. **Buyer qualification**: What indicates someone is a good fit for your paid offer?
5. **Delivery preference**: Do they prefer reading, watching, or using tools?
6. **Timeline urgency**: How quickly do they need results?
7. **Current offer**: What are you eventually selling them?

## The Hook Formula Framework

Great lead magnets have irresistible hooks. Use these formulas:

### 1. The Shortcut
"Get [desired result] without [painful process]"

**Examples**:
- "Build a website without coding or hiring a developer"

### 2. The Template/Swipe File
"Steal my exact [template/script/system] for [result]"

**Examples**:

**Examples**:

**Examples**:

### 6. The Case Study/Breakdown
"How [specific person/company] achieved [impressive result]—step by step"

**Examples**:
- "How I went from 0 to 10K subscribers in 90 days"
- "The exact funnel that generated $2M last year"
- "How [Company] cut churn by 40%"

## The Validation Checklist

Score each lead magnet idea (Yes = 1, No = 0):

### Specificity Test
- [ ] Does the title promise a specific outcome?
- [ ] Is the audience clearly defined?
- [ ] Is the transformation measurable?
- [ ] Could someone picture the end result?

### Speed-to-Value Test
- [ ] Can they get value within 10 minutes of downloading?
- [ ] Is there a quick win or immediate takeaway?
- [ ] Does it solve an urgent (not important-but-not-urgent) problem?

### Relevance Test
- [ ] Does it attract your ideal buyer (not just anyone)?
- [ ] Is the problem related to what you sell?
- [ ] Would solving this problem make them want your paid solution?
- [ ] Does it disqualify bad-fit leads?

### Quality Test
- [ ] Would people pay $20+ for this?
- [ ] Does it demonstrate your expertise?
- [ ] Is it better than free content on the topic?

**Scoring**:
- 12+: Strong lead magnet, proceed
- 9-11: Good potential, refine weak areas
- Below 9: Reconsider the concept

## Opt-In Page Essentials

Minimum viable landing page elements:

1. **Headline**: Lead with the transformation, not the format
   - Bad: "Download My Free PDF"
   - Good: "The 5-Minute Daily Routine That 10X'd My Productivity"

2. **Subheadline**: Address the pain or promise speed
   - "Stop wasting 3 hours a day on busywork"

3. **Bullet Points** (3-5): Specific outcomes they'll get
   - Use numbers, timeframes, specifics
   - "The exact template I used to..."

4. **Social Proof** (optional but powerful):
   - "Join 10,000+ marketers"
   - Testimonial about the lead magnet

5. **Form**: Email only (reduce friction)
   - Add name only if personalization is critical

6. **CTA Button**: Action-oriented, specific
   - Bad: "Submit"
   - Good: "Send Me The Checklist"

## Output Format

When creating a lead magnet, deliver:

1. **Concept Brief**: Target audience, pain point, transformation
2. **Hook Options**: 3-5 headline variations using the formulas
3. **Format Recommendation**: Best format with rationale
4. **Validation Scorecard**: 12-point checklist results
5. **Landing Page Copy**: Headline, subheadline, bullets, CTA
6. **Lead Magnet Content**: The actual asset (or outline for complex pieces)
